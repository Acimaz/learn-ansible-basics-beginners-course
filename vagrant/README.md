# Build your own Ansible lab

These instructions supersede those found in the appendix of this course so *ignore* those videos as you won't get far. Besides, they tell you to install CentOS 7 which no longer works. The original instructions were created before Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3) came on the scene and before CentOS 7 was withdrawn by Red Hat.

What is presented here will work for Windows, Intel Mac and Apple Silicon Mac.

Rather than going through the individual steps of manually creating the virtual machines in VirtualBox (which is what does not work on newer Macs), we instead automate the creation of the VMs using Vagrant which can drive both VirtualBox (Windows/Intel Mac) and VMware Fusion (Apple Silicon) from the same inputs.
